This is a personal TODO list.

Clean up board init, free up some space
Do we need different LD script and c_startup for different uCs??
Shut up a shitload of warnings from usb_lib
Merge here all the CREDITS, Licensing info and other shit
Wrap altsettings in macros, add API for adding custom endpoints
Merge Xilinx-SSCU for Mcortex
Add support for boards: mcortex mctx-dm sISP ucGUN, etc.
Talk with leaflabs, merge&check their boards
fix coding style!!!
